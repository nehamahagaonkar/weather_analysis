Weather Data Analysis

Overview: Conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Kaggle-sourced weather dataset to identify patterns, trends, and insights into weather conditions.
=>Key Objectives:
>Analyze temperature, precipitation, humidity, and other weather parameters over time.
Derive actionable insights by exploring seasonal and regional variations.
>Techniques and Tools Used:
Data Manipulation: Used Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the dataset.
Visualization: Generated detailed visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to present key findings, including time-series analysis and correlation heatmaps.
Descriptive Statistics: Applied statistical measures to summarize and interpret key weather metrics.
>Handling Missing Data: Identified and addressed gaps in the dataset to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
>>Outcomes:
Successfully identified trends in weather data, such as temperature fluctuations and rainfall patterns.
Developed clear, data-driven insights to support decision-making in weather-related planning and analysis.
